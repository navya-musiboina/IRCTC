This is a detailed overview of the IRCTC-like ticket booking system portal design. Here's a breakdown of the system's features and design:

System Features
1. User Authentication: Signup for new users and login for existing users, with encrypted storage of user credentials for added security.
2. Train Search: Uses binary search algorithm to search and verify existing users and trains.
3. Route Search: Searches for direct trains between source and destination, and if not available, uses graph algorithms to find indirect routes.
4. Ticket Booking: Asks for passenger details, saves the details, and asks for payment method.
5. Ticket Generation: Prints the complete ticket details.

Technical Details
1. Programming Language: C++.
2. GUI Framework: Qt.
3. Development Environment: Windows OS, Qt Creator 5.5.1.
4. Project Setup: The project is set up in a specific folder (D:/qt/irctc3), and file paths may need to be adjusted if the project is cloned to a different folder.

Design Considerations
1. Security: Encryption of user credentials for added security.
2. Efficiency: Use of binary search algorithm for fast searching and verification.
3. Route Optimization: Use of graph algorithms to find indirect routes when direct trains are not available.

Overall, this system design seems to cover the key features and functionality of an IRCTC-like ticket booking system. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
